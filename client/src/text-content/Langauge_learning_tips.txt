Make a note that we are going to link to that human communication or language as an innate ability, and go to a few pages that I like related to how language was acquired, and the birth of language, the history of language, things like that. But it's just going to be a link. 

FAQ: The Difference Between Language, Reading, and Writing
Language vs. Reading and Writing:
Language is an innate human ability, a system for communication that’s spoken or signed. Reading and writing, on the other hand, are technologies—methods for recording language over time and across distances. They’re not language itself.

Learning through Reading:
While reading can be a useful tool for language learning, it’s important to remember that it’s not the same as speaking or listening. Reading often reflects what’s been spoken, but to be able to speak a language, the primary focus must be on listening and speaking.

Signed Language vs. Written Language:
Signed language (such as American Sign Language or others) is a visual representation of spoken language, but its purpose is purely communicative. It’s not meant for long-term preservation or documentation, unlike writing. Think of signed language as a visual counterpart to spoken language, not as a form of reading or writing.

The Video Parallel:
Just as a written transcript preserves a spoken conversation for later, making a video of a signed conversation captures the same essence, but in a visual, communicative form. This highlights that language itself is spoken or signed, not read or written.

Higher-Level Reading Skills:
At higher levels of language learning, there are more reading and writing skills to develop. Understanding conventions and structures in written language becomes essential, because language has specific ways it is written down, including different writing styles, formalities, and rhetoric.

"The app is pretty good at understanding what you're trying to do, and it’s designed to guess what you need. If you want to switch things up, just let it know—like, 'I want to practice the past tense,' or 'I’m talking about my sister, not my brother.' If you're clear, the app will adjust and help keep the conversation going the way you want."
