        <p className="lead">
          Welcome to the computer assisted language learning website. My name is <strong>Matthew Werth</strong> 
          and I have been a language teacher for many years. Currently I am working on 
          a number of automated tools to make life easier for language teachers and language learners.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool is an automated language exchange chatbot for students who want to practice their 
          language skills. It is divided into three levels with fine tuned prompts to make language 
          learning easier. The guiding philosophy is <strong>CI with TPRS</strong>, especially at the lower levels.

        <p>
          The chatbot is powered by{' '}
          <a href="https://openai.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-decoration-none">
            OpenAI
          </a>, this is a wrapper for the GPT 4.0 model that has been optimized for conversation 
          based on the level that you choose.
        </p>

        <Row className="mt-4">
          <Col md={6}>
            <h5 className="text-secondary mb-3">Important Notes:</h5>
            <ul className="list-unstyled">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <Badge bg="info" className="me-2">Info</Badge>
                The model responses are usually factually accurate, but there is no guarantee and that isn't important for language learning
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <Badge bg="warning" className="me-2">Warning</Badge>
                GPT hallucinates sometimes, so if the conversation gets too weird, just change the topic and carry on
              </li>
              <li className="mb-2">
                <Badge bg="secondary" className="me-2">Note</Badge>
                You, the human, are ultimately responsible for what happens in these conversations. ChatGPT is generally 
                eager to please, so it's easy to get it to say weird and/or unsavory things, but that's usually because 
                the computer thinks that's what you wanted based on your side of the text.
