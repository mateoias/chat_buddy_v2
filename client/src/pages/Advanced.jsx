        <p>
          Advanced chat sessions focus on real-world language use, idiomatic expressions, and conversational flow. Topics will be deeper—covering culture, current events, or abstract ideas. You’ll be encouraged to sustain conversation, use a range of grammar, and correct yourself naturally. Don’t worry if you struggle at first—that’s part of the growth.

        <h2>🧠 Why use Chat Buddy?</h2>
        <p>
If you speak a language fluently, ChatGPT can be a good conversation partner. However, even for advanced speakers it can be frustrating. 
Chat GPT will cut you off if you pause even briefly.s It will switch between languages when it misunderstands you
and it will talk for a long time when you want to practice your speaking.

        <h2>📘 Why use Chat Buddy</h2>
        <p>
          You’ve already learned the most common verbs and vocabulary—now you’ll explore academic terms, slang, and complex tenses like subjunctive, passive voice, and conditionals. Chat Buddy will help you use them in context rather than studying them in isolation. The aim is mastery by doing.

        <h2>🚀 Strategies for Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Speak freely, listen deeply. Review vocabulary after each session and try to reuse it. Ask Chat Buddy to correct you or explain something in detail if you’re unsure. Don’t be afraid to get philosophical or emotional—those moments are when the best learning happens. Take risks, reflect, and enjoy the process.
